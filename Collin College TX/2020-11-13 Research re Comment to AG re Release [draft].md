## Research/drafting for comment/letter to AG
Outside counsel for CC wants to exclude everything matching most of my
requests as being in "anticipation of litigation" and because of
attorney-client privilege.

Texas allows me to comment/respond to the AG about this.

### Open Records Decisions

Re anticipation of litigation: [https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/ord-files/ord/2020/ord19960638.pdf](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/ord-files/ord/2020/ord19960638.pdf) (No. 638, 1996)
* need "concrete evidence ... more than mere conjecture." Open Records Decision No. 482 (1986) at 4.
* "On the other hand, this office has determined that if an individual publicly threatens to bring suit against a governmental body, but does not actually take objective steps toward filing suit, litigation is not reasonably anticipated. See Open Records Decision No. 331 (1982). ‘Nor does the mere fact that an individual hires an attorney and alleges damages serve to establish that litigation is reasonably anticipated. Open Records Decision No. 361 (1983) at 2. Of course, the fact that someone has actually filed suit against the governmental party clearly shows that litigation is pending." (at 3)
* Must relate to litigation  and must show why those *particular* records relate. (at 4)

Re anticipation of litigation: [https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/ord-files/ord/2020/ord19900555.pdf](https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/ord-files/ord/2020/ord19900555.pdf) (No. 555, 1990)
* We conclude that because steps toward litigation have been taken, i.e., the hiring of an attorney and the assertions of that attorney of an intent to sue, litigation is reasonably anticipated in this case. &D Open Records Decision Nos. 551 (1990); 383 (1983); 289 (1981). (at 3)

### Thoughts
* Expressing even a reasonable fear of litigation because it has been publicly accused of violating an employee's fundamental rights does not meet Collin College's burden of showing that "litigation is reasonably anticipated." See Open Records Decision No. 331 (1982), Open Records Decision No. 361 (1983) at 2. Sufficient "objective steps towards filing suit" must be taken, such as the hiring of an attorney combined with assertions of an intent to sue. Open Records Decision No. 331 (1982), Open Records Decision No. 555 (1990). 
* Collin College has shown insufficient evidence that any such "objective steps" have been taken in this case.
* (Refute also with public statements from FIRE letter or Tweets disclaiming intent to sue?)

## Info from Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas (11/13/20) - Bill Aleshire 
Very helpful people. They have a [FOI Hotline](http://foift.org/resources/foi-hotline/) that talked me through this part of the process (not legal advice, etc.)
* I can call my letter to the AG a "response from requestor" 
* The Foundation has been lobbying to reduce the scope of the "anticipated litigation" exception, which they consider overbroad and overused
* Suggested parsing FIRE letters carefully to see what they have communicated about threat of litigation
