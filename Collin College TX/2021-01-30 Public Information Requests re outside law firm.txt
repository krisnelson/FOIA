Dear Ms. Cadena-Smith:
 
I am writing to request the following public information under Texas Government Code Chapter 
552:

1.	All public information related to invoicing by, billing by, or payments to the law 
firm of Clark Hill Strasburger, its employees, or the attorney Pete Thompson dated 
from 10/1/2020 to the present.
2.	All public information involving communications to or from the law firm of Clark 
Hill Strasburger, its employees, or the attorney Pete Thompson dated from 
10/1/2020 to the present.
I agree to the redaction of information that is subject to mandatory exceptions, provided such 
redactions are clearly labeled on the information I received.
 
I also agree to the redaction of information that is subject to discretionary exceptions (including 
attorney-client privilege, of particular importance as this request involves information related 
to an outside law firm), provided such redactions are clearly labeled on the information I 
receive.
 
I would like copies of the requested public information to be provided to me in electronic 
format.
 
The information resulting from this request is intended to be used as a public service to educate 
and inform the general public. As such, I request a waiver or reduction of any charges 
associated with this request under § 552.267. If there is nonetheless a charge associated with 
this request, please inform me in advance and provide a breakdown of the costs, per TAC § 
70.7, such that I may approve the charge or modify my request to reduce or eliminate any 
costs.
 
Please let me know of any questions or clarifications that would assist with responding to these 
three requests for public information. 
 
Thank you,
 
Kristopher Nelson
