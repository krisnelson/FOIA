## Research/drafting for comment/letter to AG
Outside counsel for CC wants to exclude everything matching most of my
requests as being in "anticipation of litigation" and because of
attorney-client privilege.

Texas allows me to comment/respond to the AG about this.

* need "concrete evidence ... more than mere conjecture." Open Records Decision No. 482 (1986) at 4.
* "On the other hand, this office has determined that if an individual publicly threatens to bring suit against a governmental body, but does not actually take objective steps toward filing suit, litigation is not reasonably anticipated. See Open Records Decision No. 33 1 (1982). ‘Nor does the mere fact that an individual hires an attorney and alleges damages serve to establish that litigation is reasonably anticipated. Open Records Decision No. 361 (1983) at 2. Of course, the fact that someone has actually filed suit against the governmental party clearly shows that litigation is pending." (at 3)
* Must relate to litigation  and must show why those *particular* records relate. (at 4)

* We conclude that because steps toward litigation have been taken, i.e., the hiring of an attorney and the assertions of that attorney of an intent to sue, litigation is reasonably anticipated in this case. &D Open Records Decision Nos. 551 (1990); 383 (1983); 289 (1981). (at 3)
