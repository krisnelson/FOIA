# Florida request template

Dear Custodian of Public Records:

In accordance with Article I, Section 24 of the Florida Constitution and the Florida Public Records Act, Section 119, F.S., I am requesting electronic copies of the following public records:

1. **Public records constituting ___.**
2. **Public records related to ___.**

As I am requesting electronic copies of these records to be delivered via email or similar electronic delivery, and as there are no “actual costs of duplication” for delivering records electronically, I expect that, in accordance with AGO 2013-03, there will be no charge to fulfill the above requests.

If these public records are subject to an exemption or are confidential, I ask that you provide details of the basis for that exemption or determination, per § 119.07(e), including the reasons for that conclusion, as detailed in § 119.07(f).

If clarification, narrowing, or rephrasing of the above requests would be helpful in order to more effectively fulfill them, please let me know so that I may do so promptly. Similarly, if these requests are better directed to another Florida state entity, I would appreciate being informed of that.

I look forward to the prompt and good faith acknowledgment and response to my requests as required by § 119.07(c).
