# California request template

In accordance with the California Public Records Act, Gov’t Code § 6250 *et seq.*:, I am requesting electronic copies of the following public records:

1. **Records or information ____.**

Per Gov’t Code § 6253.9(a), I would like to receive electronic copies of these public records via email or, per § 6253(f), access to electronic copies via an internet website. In the event there is nonetheless a fee or cost associated with my request under any statutory provisions, please inform me of the reason for the fee, the amount, and the mechanism for payment as soon as possible.

If these public records are subject to an exemption or are confidential or implicate the right of individuals to privacy, I ask that you provide details of the basis for that exemption or determination and any appeal procedures.

Assistance in improving or clarifying these requests to better identify appropriate responsive records and information, as envisioned by Gov’t Code §  6253.1(a), would be much appreciated. Similarly, if these requests are better directed to another California state entity, I would appreciate being informed of that.

I look forward to a reply to this request within the mandated 10 days. Gov’t Code § 6253(c).
