Clerk's individual email: clerk@cityofsanteeca.gov

### Surveillance?
I am writing to obtain electronic copies of the following records from the City of Santee under the California Public Records Act, Gov’t Code § 6250 *et seq.*: 
 
1. Any public records related to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department’s actual or potential “SafeSanDiego,” “SafeSanDiego-Lemon Grove,” or “SafeSanDiego-Santee” programs or to an actual or potential San Diego County Sheriff's Department “video federation and integration” system. (For context and clarification, I have attached a copy of a Sheriff’s Department Staff Report to the City of Lemon Grove.)

2. More broadly, any reports, proposals, plans, requests, memorandums, communications, or similar documents and public records concerning potential or actual video surveillance or video monitoring in the City of Santee by, on behalf of, or made available to, any local, state, or federal law-enforcement agency, such as, but not limited to, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Customs and Border Protection, and dated after on or after January 1, 2019
 
I request that responsive records be delivered to me in electronic format via email or similar electronic delivery mechanism, per § 6253.9.

In the event there is a fee authorized under § 6253(b), please inform me of the reason for the fee, the amount, and the mechanism for payment as soon as possible.

Please let me know of any questions or clarifications that would assist with responding to these two public-records requests. You may reach me by email at xxx@xxxxxx.xxx or by phone at (XXX) XXX-XXXX.

Thank you,
Kristopher Nelson
