Mr. Nelson,

In response to your request for public record received November 2, 2020, regarding the 
SafeSanDiego program within the City of Lemon Grove.  Documents responding are 
attached.  Some clarification for your records:  The City of Lemon Grove does not have an 
agreement with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department for the SafeSanDiego Program 
specifically, as the agreement (attached) with the Sheriff's Department they are allowed to run 
programs within the City that are not required to hold a separate agreement.  This is the case 
with this SafeSanDiego program as this is a pilot program that the Sheriff's Department is using 
within the City of Lemon Grove boundaries and other cities within San Diego County.  In 
addition, any businesses within the City of Lemon Grove who chooses to participate in the 
program are involved in an agreement between those two entities (business and Sheriff's 
Dept.), the City has no involvement in that partnership.  

A public flyer has been included as responding document which explains the program and 
provides a website that I encourage you to visit for more information on the program.
 
 
Original Request:
1. Any public records related to the San Diego County Sheriff's Department's actual or potential 
"SafeSanDiego" or "SafeSanDiego-Lemon Grove" programs or to an actual or potential San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department "video federation and integration" system. (For context and
clarification, see the previously attached a copy of a Sheriff's Department Staff Report to the 
City of Lemon Grove.)  2. More broadly, any reports, proposals, plans, requests, memorandums, 
communications, or similar documents and public records concerning potential or actual video 
surveillance or video monitoring in the City of Lemon Grove by, on behalf of, or made available 
to, any local, state, or federal law enforcement agency, such as, but not limited to, the San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Customs and 
Border Protection, and dated after on or after January 1, 2019.
