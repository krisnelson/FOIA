In accordance with the California Public Records Act, Gov’t Code § 6250 et seq., I am requesting electronic copies of the following public records:

A list, preferably in CSV or Excel spreadsheet format, of all Public Record Requests submitted to the Oakland Police Department between February 25, 2018 and February 25, 2021 that took more than 3 months to complete or that are still open after 3 months and that are tracked in the "NextRequest" system. Please include at least the Request #, Received date, current Status, Request Description, and Point of Contact. If readily achievable without undue additional work, please include all tracked database fields in a CSV or Excel spreadsheet export of responsive records.

Per Gov’t Code § 6253.9(a), I would like to receive electronic copies of these public records via email or, per § 6253(f), access to electronic copies via an internet website. In the event there is nonetheless a fee or cost associated with my request under any statutory provisions, please inform me of the reason for the fee, the amount, and the mechanism for payment as soon as possible.

If these public records are subject to an exemption or are confidential or implicate the right of individuals to privacy, I ask that you provide details of the basis for that exemption or determination and any appeal procedures.

Assistance in improving or clarifying these requests to better identify appropriate responsive records and information, as envisioned by Gov’t Code §  6253.1(a), would be much appreciated.
